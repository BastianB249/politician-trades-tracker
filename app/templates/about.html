  <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">About Capitol Trades Tracker</h1>
  <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">Capitol Trades Tracker aggregates public financial disclosure reports from US lawmakers. These disclosures can be delayed and are not real-time trading signals.</p>
  <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">How performance is computed</h2>
  <p class="text-slate-600 mb-4">For each disclosed buy transaction, we compute a simple return over 1-year and 5-year windows using local price snapshots. We also compute the same return for the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) over the exact window, and the reported "excess return" is the difference between those two averages.</p>
